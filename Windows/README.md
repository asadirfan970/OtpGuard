   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Update the `base_url` in `main.py` to point to your backend API server
2. Ensure your Android device is connected via USB with USB debugging enabled
3. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Login**
   - Enter your email and password
   - The application will automatically detect and register your MAC address on first login

2. **Select Script**
   - Choose an automation script from the dropdown menu
   - Select the target country for phone number validation

3. **Upload Numbers**
   - Click "Upload numbers.txt" and select a text file containing phone numbers

## Building an Executable

To create a standalone executable:

```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.ico main.py
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` directory.

## Security Notes

- The application stores your login token locally in `config.json`
- Your MAC address is used for device binding and cannot be changed after registration
- Temporary script files are automatically deleted after execution
- All API communications are encrypted (HTTPS)

## Troubleshooting

- **ADB not found**: Ensure ADB is installed and added to your system PATH
- **Device not detected**: Check USB connection and enable USB debugging on your Android device
- **Login issues**: Verify your credentials and internet connection
- **Script errors**: Check the logs for detailed error messages
